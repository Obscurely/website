## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit websites. They
help websites remember information about your visit.

## My Approach to Cookies

This website takes a privacy-first approach to analytics and **does not use
tracking cookies**.

## What I Use Instead

I use **Umami Analytics**, a privacy-focused analytics tool that:

- Uses local browser storage (not cookies)
- Collects anonymous usage data only
- Cannot identify or track individual users
- Stores data temporarily in your browser
- Resets when you close your browser

## Essential Website Functions

This website may use minimal technical data stored locally in your browser to
ensure basic functionality, such as remembering your preferences or maintaining
secure connections. This data is not used for tracking and is automatically
cleared when you close your browser.

## Data I Collect

The analytics collect only anonymous information:

- Pages you visit on my site
- How you found my site (referral source)
- General location (country level)
- Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Browser type

## Your Control

Since I don't use tracking cookies:

- No consent banners are needed
- No cookie settings to manage
- Data is automatically cleared when you close your browser
- You can disable JavaScript to prevent all analytics

## Third-Party Services

I do not use third-party advertising or tracking services that would place
cookies on your device.
