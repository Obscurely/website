## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit websites. They
help websites remember information about your visit.

## My Approach to Cookies

This website takes a privacy-first approach to analytics and **does not use
tracking cookies**.

## What I Use Instead

I use privacy-focused analytics tools that respect your privacy:

**Vercel Analytics:**

- Does not use cookies or store personal data
- Collects anonymous performance and usage metrics
- Cannot track individual users across sessions
- Does not store IP addresses
- Automatically aggregates and anonymizes all data

## Essential Website Functions

This website may use minimal technical data stored locally in your browser to
ensure basic functionality, such as remembering your preferences or maintaining
secure connections. This data is not used for tracking and is automatically
cleared when you close your browser.

## Data I Collect

The analytics collect only anonymous information:

- Pages you visit on my site
- How you found my site (referral source)
- General location (country/region level)
- Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Browser type
- Website performance metrics (page load times, Core Web Vitals)

## Your Control

Since I don't use tracking cookies:

- No consent banners are needed
- No cookie settings to manage
- Data is automatically cleared when you close your browser
- You can disable JavaScript to prevent all analytics

## Third-Party Services

I do not use third-party advertising or tracking services that would place
cookies on your device. The analytics service I use (Vercel Analytics) is
specifically chosen for its privacy-first approach and cookie-free operation.
