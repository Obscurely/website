## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO I COLLECT?

### Personal information you disclose to me

**In Short:** I collect personal information that you provide to me.

I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to me when you
express an interest in obtaining information about me or my products and
Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when
you contact me.

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that I
collect depends on the context of your interactions with me and the Services,
the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal
information I collect may include the following:

- email addresses
- names

**Sensitive Information.** I do not process sensitive information.

All personal information that you provide to me must be true, complete, and
accurate, and you must notify me of any changes to such personal information.

### Information automatically collected

**In Short:** I use Umami analytics to understand basic website usage patterns
through anonymized data without cookies or tracking individual users.

I use Umami analytics to collect anonymized information about how visitors use
my website. This information does not reveal your specific identity and includes
basic usage statistics such as page views, referrer information, and general
geographic regions. This information is primarily needed to understand how my
website is being used so I can improve it.

Unlike many analytics services, Umami does not use cookies, does not track
individual users, and does not collect personally identifiable information.

## 2. HOW DO I PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** I process your information to provide, improve, and administer my
Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply
with law. I process the personal information for the following purposes listed
below. I may also process your information for other purposes only with your
prior explicit consent.

I process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how
you interact with my Services, including:

- **To respond to contact form inquiries.** Processing contact form submissions
  including names, email addresses, and messages to respond to visitor inquiries
  about services, projects, or collaboration opportunities.
- **To analyze website usage.** I use Umami analytics to understand how my
  website is being used so I can improve it through anonymized usage data.
- **To save or protect an individual's vital interest.** I may process your
  information when necessary to save or protect an individual's vital interest,
  such as to prevent harm.

## 3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

**In Short:** I may share information in specific situations described in this
section and/or with the following third parties.

I may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Analytics Service.** I use Umami analytics service to understand website
  usage patterns through anonymized data.
- **Comment System.** I use Giscus for website comments, which processes your
  GitHub account information when you choose to comment on my blog posts.
- **Business Transfers.** I may share or transfer your information in connection
  with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets,
  financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of my business to another
  company.

## 4. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**In Short:** I aim to protect your personal information through a system of
organizational and technical security measures.

I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I
process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that
hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to
defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information,
transmission of personal information to and from my Services is at your own
risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions,
such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and
Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain
rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject
to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly
significant effects is made solely by automated means, I will inform you,
explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In
certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing
of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting me by
using the contact details provided in the section
"[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#14-how-can-you-contact-me-about-this-notice)"
below.

I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data
protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe I am unlawfully processing
your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member
State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection
and Information Commissioner.

**Withdrawing your consent:** If I am relying on your consent to process your
personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You
can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact
details provided in the section
"[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#14-how-can-you-contact-me-about-this-notice)"
below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the
processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
processing grounds other than consent.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email me at
privacy@adriancrismaruc.com.

## 6. DO I COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

**In Short:** I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under
18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.

I do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18
years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor
do I knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you
represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in
your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If I learn that personal
information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as
specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, I will deactivate the
account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my
records. If you become aware of any data I may have collected from children
under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction,
please contact me at privacy@adriancrismaruc.com.

## 7. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** I only process your personal information when I believe it is
necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under
applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with
services to enter into or fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your
rights, or to fulfill my legitimate business interests.

### If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to explain
the valid legal bases I rely on in order to process your personal information.
As such, I may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal
information:

- **Consent.** I may process your information if you have given me permission
  (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You
  can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your
  consent.

- **Legitimate Interests.** I may process your information when I believe it is
  reasonably necessary to achieve my legitimate business interests and those
  interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
  For example, I may process your personal information for some of the purposes
  described in order to:
  - Analyze how my Services are used so I can improve them to engage and retain
    users
  - In order to communicate with potential clients and collaborators who reach
    out through the website.

- **Legal Obligations.** I may process your information where I believe it is
  necessary for compliance with my legal obligations, such as to cooperate with
  a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend my legal
  rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which I am
  involved.

- **Vital Interests.** I may process your information where I believe it is
  necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third
  party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
  person.

### If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

I may process your information if you have given me specific permission (i.e.,
express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You
can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, I may be legally permitted under applicable law to
process your information without your consent, including, for example:

- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot
  be obtained in a timely way
- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
  assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next
  of kin
- If I have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
  victim of financial abuse
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise
  the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is
  reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
  contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
  rules of the court relating to the production of records
- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
  business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for
  which the information was produced
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

I may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics
projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments

## 8. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.

I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for
the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is
required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require me keeping your personal
information for longer than contact form submissions: until the inquiry is
resolved or 2 years, whichever comes first, or upon user's request for deletion.

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is
not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and
isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 9. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

**In Short:** I may transfer, store, and process your information in countries
other than your own.

My servers are located in Germany, Ireland, Romania, United States and
Switzerland. If you are accessing my Services from outside Germany, Ireland,
Romania, United States and Switzerland, please be aware that your information
may be transferred to, stored by, and processed by me in my facilities and in
the facilities of the third parties with whom I may share your personal
information (see
"[WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?](#3-when-and-with-whom-do-i-share-your-personal-information)"
above), in and other countries.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection
laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, I
will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in
accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.

### European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:

I have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by
using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of
personal information between my group companies and between me and my
third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all
personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in
accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. My Standard
Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. I have implemented similar
appropriate safeguards with my third-party service providers and partners and
further details can be provided upon request.

laws, including the right to:
