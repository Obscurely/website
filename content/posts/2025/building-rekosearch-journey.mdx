## When Digital Hoarding Becomes a Real Problem

About a year and a half ago, I was looking for my next big project, but I wasn't
sure what it would be. Fortunately, while I was trying to filter through my
media and find some very specific photos and videos, I encountered a problem
that motivated me to build this.

The problem is that I have literally over 10,000 photos and videos, and while
they are organized by year and even by period, that still results in hundreds
per folder. Going through everything to find exactly what I need takes time, and
a lot of it.

While there are tools that allow you to find a piece of media by face or search
for text within them, they either don't provide in-depth enough searching
capabilities, a broad enough scope of things to search for, or are tailored to a
particular use case.

## RekoSearch: Semantic Search Across All Your Content

RekoSearch, on the other hand, allows you to simultaneously search across
photos, videos, documents, and audio files semantically, using natural language
queries.

<FeatureGrid>
  <FeatureCard
    title="Natural Language Search"
    description="Search using phrases like 'dog mountain' to find all photos and videos with mountains and dogs"
    icon="🔍"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Multi-Format Support"
    description="Search across photos, videos, documents, and audio files simultaneously"
    icon="📁"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    title="Advanced Queries"
    description="Use Boolean operators and filters for precise results with complex search logic"
    icon="⚡"
  />
</FeatureGrid>

For example, you may be looking for something simple like "dog mountain" which
in this case would return all photos and videos having a mountain and a dog in
them or a phrase like "happy birthday" which will return photos, videos,
documents and audio files containing either the sentence "happy birthday" or
happy people and a birthday-like scene.

Or you may have a more advanced need, in which case, consider this example: you
have created a new product, such as a couch, and recorded a promotional video
for it, but it required many takes. You specifically want to look at those that
feature the product, the brand name, and the person in them is not sad. In this
case, you could do an advanced search query like this:

```
label:couch AND text:"brand name" NOT face:sad
```

Furthermore, RekoSearch also features functions such as filtering, saving
searches, downloading results, and many more features planned for
implementation.

Building this, however, turned out to be far more complex than I initially
anticipated.

## The Technical Challenge: Why This Was Hard to Build

At first, thinking about how to build it didn't seem that hard, but I soon
realized this was way more complex than I expected. Even a simple thing, such as
authentication and authorization for someone like me who hasn't implemented
OAuth 2.0 from scratch before, was challenging. Still, you have to ensure it's
secure when actual people's money is involved.

Another challenge that has arisen as I've delved deeper into the project is the
sheer size and complexity of managing everything. You have infrastructure, API
methods each with their own program (15+ Lambda functions), backend processing
servers, which in themselves could be entirely separate projects, and the
frontend Homepage and Dashboard (which are both separate entities). To make a
change or add something new, you need to ensure it propagates and works well
with everything else, from the backbone to what the user sees.

Plus many other challenges related, but not limited to (with non-exhaustive
examples):

- **Scalability**: processing many files without delays, wasting resources and
  unnecessary costs (solution: scheduling job processors on AWS Fargate).
- **Security**: ensuring user data is handled securely, encrypted, and access to
  it is limited.
- **Performance**: not leaving out resources unused in case of processing simple
  files like images, and thus processing multiple in parallel for faster
  processing times.
- **Cost Optimization**: Utilizing the cheapest hosting options (e.g, using
  Digital Ocean instead of AWS for the Kubernetes cluster) and building more
  efficient components (e.g, using Rust Lambda functions).
- **AWS Service Integration**: Learning and utilizing the SDK for each AWS
  service, all of them having their own tricks and ways of handling things.
- **Niche Implementation Challenges**: Things that you would think someone has
  to have implemented a way to do this, or there has to be a standard defined,
  only to find out there isn't, and you are all on your own. An example in this
  case would be reliably counting the pages in a PDF file, tamper-proof and
  exploit-proof, by streaming it and doing so exceptionally fast.

Combine all of these, and from the 3-4 months I initially thought it would take
me to develop this, I am **1.5 years and over 60,000 lines of code later**, and
this is only the start of the beta.

Yet, by no means do I regret taking on this project; in fact, I am actually
thrilled. The amount of knowledge I gained in this year and a half of building a
proper, enterprise-like SaaS application is something I could never have
acquired by building smaller desktop apps.

## The Tech Stack

I could not possibly explain everything in a paragraph or two here, so if you
are interested in a deep dive, please don't hesitate to check the public
repository containing highly in-depth documentation and technical diagrams that
cover every aspect of it: https://github.com/Obscurely/RekoSearch-Public

<StepGuide>
  <Step number={1} title="Infrastructure">
    All managed by Terraform.
    
    - **AWS Services** for managing stuff like login (Cognito), databases (DynamoDB), storage (S3) and the processing of the files (Rekognition, Textract and Transcribe).
    - **Kubernetes Cluster** on DigitalOcean for hosting the Dashboard, the Queue Processor (which listens to jobs pushed to the SQS queue and spins up job processing applications on AWS Fargate, allowing for infinite job processing scalability), the stats application (Grafana), and the analytics application (Umami).
  </Step>

<Step number={2} title="Backend">
  All programmed in **Rust**, allowing for fast and safe execution of all the
  backend services, as well as lower costs in case of AWS Lambda (pre-compiled
  Rust functions are much quicker and lighter weight and can also run on arm64,
  making them dirt cheap).
</Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Frontend">
    Built using **TypeScript and Python**, it's split into two components:
    
    - **The homepage**: a Next.js static website exported and hosted on S3 behind Cloudfront, handles any amount of traffic with ease and at a very low cost.
    - **The Dashboard**: a React SPA hosted on the Kubernetes cluster using Gunicorn (production WSGI server) and Flask as the business logic layer. It can be scaled as needed, and in this case, users pay for it when processing their files.
  </Step>
</StepGuide>

<Callout type="success" title="The Power of Rust + ARM64">
  Here's how much of a crazy difference developing your Lambda functions in Rust
  and running them on ARM makes: - Rust lambda functions execute on average **10
  to 100 times faster** than Python-based ones. - Say you pay about $100 a month
  for Lambda functions written in Python that run on x86. If you convert to
  arm64, you save about 20%, so you are down to about 80%. If you convert to
  Rust due to its greater efficiency, you will be down to about $15-30 per
  month. **That's a 70-85% reduction in costs!**

## What's Next

I plan to continually work on and improve this project, as it's very close to my
heart and I genuinely enjoy working on it. Some of the features I have planned
that are in my immediate attention include:

- **Implementing the use of parentheses** in the search query to allow writing
  complex queries easier. Currently, the search follows the algebraic Boolean
  order.
- **Implementing an API keys system**, allowing the use of the API outside the
  Dashboard.
- **Adding support for more file types** by converting them on the server.
- **Adding social provider identities** for login (OIDC for Google, etc.)
- **Implementing a library-like feature** for organizing searches, files,
  combining multiple jobs and other features to turn it into a fully fledged
  knowledge mining platform.

My long-term vision for RekoSearch is tied to the last feature I mentioned. I
want to implement multiple features, including organizing, filtering, combining
various data sources, adding integrations with other platforms, and others, to
make it a one-stop solution for all knowledge mining-related needs.
